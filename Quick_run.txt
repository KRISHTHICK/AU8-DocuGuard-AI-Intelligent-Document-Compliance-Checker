README quick run
Create the folder structure and files above.

Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
(Optional) If using OpenAI LLM:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m pip install openai
Run Streamlit:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
Or run headless check (without Streamlit):

bash
Copy
Edit
python -c "from utils.extractor import extract_text_from_file; print(extract_text_from_file(('samples/sample_document.txt','sample_document.txt')))"
Design notes & next steps
Accuracy: rule-based PII detection is fast and deterministic. Add regexes for more ID types as required.

Color/format detection: python-docx can inspect inline formatting but detecting background cell colors reliably is trickier (XML access or converting to images is an option).

LLM usage: LLM can provide remediation suggestions; make sure to sanitize PII before sending to external APIs if privacy matters.

Human in the loop: Add UI elements to mark false positives and save corrected rules.

Export: Use pdfkit/wkhtmltopdf to create a PDF report from the HTML file (requires wkhtmltopdf installed on machine).

If you want I can:

Generate the entire repository ZIP (files populated) for download here.

Add a Streamlit UI page for marking findings as false positives and saving updated rules.

Add an example showing how to call a local LLM (ollama) with a specific command.

Show exactly how to sanitize PII before sending to OpenAI (redaction routine).
